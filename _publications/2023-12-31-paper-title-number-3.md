By the year 2023, the global population of individuals with impaired vision has surpassed 220 million. 
People with impaired vision will find it difficult while finding path or avoiding obstacles, and must ask 
for auxiliary tools for help. Although traditional aids such as guide canes and guide dogs exist, they still 
have some shortcomings. In this paper, we present our wearable blind guiding device, what perform 
navigation guidance through our proposed Gait-based Guiding System. Our device innovatively 
integrates gait phase analysis for walking guide, and in terms of environmental perception, we use 
multimodal sensing to acquire diverse environment information. During the experiment, we conducted 
both indoor and outdoor experiments, and compared with the standard guide cane. The result shows 
superior performance of our device in blind guidance.
