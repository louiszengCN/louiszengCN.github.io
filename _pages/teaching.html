# Non-Academic Self-Introduction

Thanks for making it this far! This page is a bit more casual and less academic - it’s all about me.

Outside the lab, I’m a sports enthusiast, traveler, photographer, and music lover. I have an outgoing and cheerful personality and enjoy socializing. I'm pretty good at basketball; I play as a power forward with excellent passing vision. I’m great at driving to the basket and scoring, and lately, I've been working hard on my mid-range shot. My favorite NBA player is Kyrie Irving.

I love traveling. I've felt the Olympic spirit under the Eiffel Tower, sipped champagne in front of the Colosseum in Rome, and presented academic reports at Cambridge University. I’ve also visited Italy, Spain, Malaysia, Monaco, Thailand, and Morocco. Currently, my dream destination is Scandinavia, where I hope to witness the Northern Lights!

Music is another passion of mine. I play the piano and hope to learn the guitar in the future. I also love singing, even though I’m not a professional, I always sing with great enthusiasm. I enjoy playing games too. If you've read my papers, you might notice one titled NeeCo. The name NeeCo sounds like Neeko, a champion in League of Legends whose passive ability allows her to transform into any unit in the game. In my paper, I use 3D Gaussian to reconstruct dynamic scenes, which can represent any dynamic unit within the scene – quite similar, right?

Oh, and I have a Border Collie named Xiaomu. During the 2020 pandemic, his owner got stuck out of town and couldn’t take care of him, so I took him in. He was just a few months old back then, but now he’s all grown up and a cherished member of my family and my best companion.

I’m always full of enthusiasm for life. My name is Tianle, which means "to live happily every day." Thanks for visiting my page and reading through this! I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, my friend!
