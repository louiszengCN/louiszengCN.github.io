<h1>Non-Academic Self-Introduction</h1>

<p>Thanks for making it this far! This page is a bit more casual and less academic - it’s all about me.</p>

<p>Outside the lab, I’m a sports enthusiast, traveler, photographer, and music lover. I have an outgoing and cheerful personality and enjoy socializing.
I'm pretty good at basketball; I play as a power forward with excellent passing vision. I’m great at driving to the basket and scoring, and lately,
I've been working hard on my mid-range shot. My favorite NBA player is Kyrie Irving.</p>

<p>I love traveling. I've felt the Olympic spirit under the Eiffel Tower, sipped champagne in front of the Colosseum in Rome,
and presented academic reports at Cambridge University.</p>

<p>I’ve also visited Italy, Spain, Malaysia, Monaco, Thailand, and Morocco. Currently, my dream destination is Scandinavia, where I hope to witness the Northern Lights!</p>

<p>Music is another passion of mine. I play the piano and hope to learn the guitar in the future. I also love singing, even though I’m not a professional, I always sing with great enthusiasm. I enjoy playing games too. If you've read my papers, you might notice one titled NeeCo. The name NeeCo sounds like Neeko, a champion in League of Legends whose passive ability allows her to transform into any unit in the game. In my paper, I use 3D Gaussian to reconstruct dynamic scenes, which can represent any dynamic unit within the scene – quite similar, right?</p>

<p>Oh, and I have a Border Collie named Xiaomu. During the Covid-19, his owner got stuck out of the city and couldn’t take care of him, so I took him in. He was just a few months old back then, but now he’s all grown up and a cherished member of my family and my best companion.</p>

<p>I’m always full of enthusiasm for life. My name is Tianle, which means "to live happily every day." Thanks for visiting my page and reading through this! I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, my friend!</p>
